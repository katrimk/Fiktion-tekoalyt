# Fiktion-tekoalyt
A Node.js app for using a MySQL database in which I have compiled information about sentient AI characters in fiction I enjoy. Only in Finnish. 
Created as a study project to practice Node and MySQL. 

At the moment, the app consists of a simple user interface that you can use to either search for every entry in the database and display it in table format, or to
search for a particular character by name. Once the list is displayed, each character's name has a link leading to a profile page for that character, containing
more information than the table listing does. I intend to add more functionalities, especially the ability to search by more parameters than only the name of
the character, and browse lists by media type. I didn't have the time to add these functions in the time frame of the study assignment this was created for, but I
would like to improve the app, so I intend to return to add these functions. I also wish to improve the appearance of the web page, and possibly add the option
for visitor input. At the moment the app is not hosted on a website, as both it and the database need improvements in order to be of use to other people interested
in sentient AI characters.

I have included the database dump in the repository in case someone wishes to see how the app works by using it with the database. It's still a very bare-bones
version of what I would like the database to be, and I intend to update and expand it, as at the moment it only includes a few characters per medium type, and is
very biased towards my most recent fiction interests. There are also more data about each character that could be added to make the database more interesting.
